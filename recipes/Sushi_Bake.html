            <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Sushi bake came around as an alternative to 
                        sushi rolls: all the flavors of creative sushi rolls 
                        layered and baked into a warm and comforting delicious 
                        casserole, meant to be scooped into little sheets of roasted seaweed.

                        <li>Crab or Seafood</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Make:</strong> Take the time to make sushi rice. 
                        You can just use plain cooked short grain rice, 
                        but taking the time to add vinegar, sugar, 
                        and salt to <em>make sushi rice</em>will take your 
                        sushi bake to a whole other level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spread:</strong> Spread the sushi rice into a oven 
                        safe dish and sprinkle with some <em>furikake</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Mix:</strong> In a bowl, mix up some shredded 
                        chopped crab with cream cheese and Kewpie mayo 
                        and then spread it on top of the rice layer. 
                        Sprinkle on a bit more furikake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pop the sushi bake into the oven 
                        and bake until it starts to brown and bubble 
                        and is heated through.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Remove from the oven and if desired, 
                        drizzle with extra kewpie mayo and sriracha. Enjoy 
                        scooped on to roasted seaweed snacks with 
                        cucumber and avocado.</li>
                </ol>
